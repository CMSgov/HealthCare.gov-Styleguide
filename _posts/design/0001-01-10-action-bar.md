# Action Bar

<div class="intro">
The Action Bar varies from page-to-page and can contain items that need to be called out, but are not quite as important as the secondary CTA. The content within in this module is flexible and should be easily updated by the content team.  The use of Glyphicons provides additional emphasis on each action item.
</div>

<div class="hr"></div>
