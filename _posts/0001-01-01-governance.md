# Governance

<div class="intro">
The purpose of the HealthCare.gov Styleguide is to centralize design, development, and editorial features used for HealthCare.gov.  It also serves to make assets publicly available in keeping with digital government strategy objectives as defined by the Federal Government. As a repository for key design elements, development assets, and editorial guidelines that are used across Healthcare.gov, the Styleguide aims to improve efficiency and ensure a consistent look and feel.

<div class="hr"></div>

A governance structure for the Styleguide will be developed to outline roles, policies, and procedures.
