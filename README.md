#Developer Site - Design Section
HealthCare.gov is supported by numerous development teams each owning a piece of the entire consumer flow.  Despite every best effort this has led to a disjointed and sometimes confusing user experience.

By creating a single place where developers and designers can come to understand, collaborate and consume a standardized repository of UI components, UX patterns and developer assets we can greatly improve the consistency and quality of the consumer experience.

  * Overview Experience
  * Digital Branding
  * Consumer Flows & Scenarios
  * Screen Patterns
  * Visual Design Specifications
  * Themes? Dark/Light?
  * UI Components
  * Examples
  * Code Snippet
  * Rationale, Parameters, Considerations for Use
* The product should define a governance structure for maintaining and updating the style of HealthCare.gov
* The product should be built using the provided governance structure within GitHub (for instance, organization / teams and fork-pull model for updates)

** adding new patterns and styles into global styleguide
