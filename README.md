#Developer Site - Design Section
HealthCare.gov is supported by numerous development teams each owning a piece of the entire consumer flow.  Despite every best effort this has led to a disjointed and sometimes confusing user experience.

By creating a single place where developers and designers can come to understand, collaborate and consume a standardized repository of UI components, UX patterns and developer assets we can greatly improve the consistency and quality of the consumer experience.

##High Level Requirements

  * Overview Experience
  * Digital Branding
  * Consumer Flows & Scenarios
  * Screen Patterns
  * Visual Design Specifications
  * Themes? Dark/Light?
  * UI Components
  * Examples
  * Code Snippet
  * Rationale, Parameters, Considerations for Use
* The product should define a governance structure for maintaining and updating the style of HealthCare.gov
* The product should be built using the provided governance structure within GitHub (for instance, organization / teams and fork-pull model for updates)
* The product should give guidance to internal designers, content and developers involved in building products under the HealthCare.gov umbrella.
* The product should provide an easy interface for developers to use assets via versions (for example, using something like Bower)
* The product should be able to handle: 
 * adding new patterns and styles into global styleguide
 * changing existing patterns and styles
* The product should ensure 508 and accessibility for UI components
