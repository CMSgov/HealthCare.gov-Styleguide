## Quick start

A couple of quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/CMSgov/HealthCare.gov-Styleguide/archive/master.zip).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/HealthCare.gov-Styleguide.git`.

Read the [Assets landing page](https://styleguide.healthcare.gov/assets/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.

### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets. You'll see something like this:

```
assets-components/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap/
│   ├── cards/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── forms/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── all.less
│   └── style.css
└── fonts/
    ├── Bitter-Bold.eot
    ├── Bitter-Italic.eot
    ├── Bitter-Regular.eot
    ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
    ├── OpenSans-Bold-webfont.eot
    ├── OpenSans-Italic-webfont.eot
    ├── OpenSans-Regular-webfont.eot
    └── OpenSans-Semibold-webfont.eot
```

We provide compiled CSS (`style.css`), as well as the CSS Less source. Glyphicon fonts are also included. Since this styleguide's functionality is built directly on top of Bootstrap, you will need to include references to our jQuery and Bootstrap code bases in your html file:

- `https://assets.healthcare.gov/resources/libs/jquery/1.11/js/jquery.min.js`
- `https://assets.healthcare.gov/resources/libs/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js`

**Note**: [Assets.healthcare.gov](https://assets.healthcare.gov) gives you Section 508 compliant, cross-browser compatible UI components that you can use in your accessible web site or web application. Assets is an accessible, responsive, and modern framework.

### Running documentation locally

  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. From the gh-pages branch root directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
